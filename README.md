**🌿 KarmaPlatform – Decentralized Acts of Kindness on the Blockchain**

KarmaPlatform is a meaningful Ethereum smart contract designed to record and reward good deeds permanently on the blockchain.
Every positive action — whether a kind message, help offered, or contribution made — becomes an immutable proof of kindness, symbolizing digital good karma.

Each entry is timestamped, publicly visible, and stored forever as a transparent record of positive impact.
