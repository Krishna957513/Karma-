🌟 KarmaPlatforms Smart Contract
A Blockchain-Based Reputation & Reward System

KarmaPlatforms.sol is a simple and transparent on-chain reputation platform where verified platforms can reward users with Karma points for good actions. These points act as non-transferable reputation tokens, building a public trust score for users across different dApps.

🧠 Overview

The Karma Platforms system is built on the idea that reputation is more valuable than currency.
Each platform (like a DApp, DAO, or organization) can register on-chain and award Karma to users who contribute positively — such as helping others, completing tasks, or supporting community initiatives.

All actions are permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.

⚙️ Features

✅ Owner-controlled registration — Only the main admin (deployer) can register new platforms.
✅ Decentralized reward system — Registered platforms can award users with Karma.
✅ Reputation tracking — Each user’s Karma balance is stored on-chain.
✅ Event logging — Every registration and reward is publicly visible via blockchain events.
✅ Non-transferable Karma — Karma cannot be sold or transferred, preserving fairness and integrity.
