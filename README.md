🌿 KarmaPlatform – Decentralized Acts of Kindness on the Blockchain

KarmaPlatform is a meaningful Ethereum smart contract designed to record and reward good deeds permanently on the blockchain.
Every positive action — whether a kind message, help offered, or contribution made — becomes an immutable proof of kindness, symbolizing digital good karma.

Each entry is timestamped, publicly visible, and stored forever as a transparent record of positive impact.


---

🧩 Smart Contract Overview

File: karmaPlatform.sol

The KarmaPlatform smart contract allows users to:

🌱 Record good deeds or acts of kindness on-chain.

💎 Earn Karma Tokens as a reward for positive contributions.

🧾 View a permanent, verifiable list of all good deeds.

🔍 Track total karma points earned across all users.



---

⚙ How It Works

1. Deploy the KarmaPlatform contract on Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible blockchain).


2. Submit your act of kindness with a short description.


3. The contract rewards you with KarmaTokens for your contribution.


4. All entries remain forever accessible as public proof of positivity.

    function recordDeed(string memory _message) public {
        uint256 reward = 10; // Fixed token reward per deed
        deeds.push(Deed(msg.sender, _message, block.timestamp, reward));
        karmaBalance[msg.sender] += reward;
        emit NewDeed(msg.sender, _message, reward, block.timestamp);
    }

    function getAllDeeds() public view returns (Deed[] memory) {
        return deeds;
    }
}
